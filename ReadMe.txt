HIRO or HIROGLIFX is a high level interpreted language implemented in Python. It's purpose is to help 
people who want to learn to write code by using a very basic syntax.
It's basic rules are as followed. 

Decorators are simply ASCII characters reserved for specific operations or uses in HIRO.
The ! decorator is used to express a conditional statement. These include if and else statements.
In addition use the # decorator to begin declaration of an integer or 'num', and $ for strings. Enclose the 
variable name followed by the 'VAR' keyword within the proper decorator.
Be sure that the closing decorator and equal sign have no space between them.  

Variable Declaration Examples:

# X VAR#= 3
$ NAME VAR$= "Noah"

As you can see variable names are capitalized within the structure (Decorator Variable_Name VARDecorator=). Also strings need
quotations to be stored in memory.
